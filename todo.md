## Phase 2: Design the Slack bot architecture and features
- [ ] Define Slack bot commands and interactions
- [ ] Choose a suitable technology stack (language, framework, database)
- [ ] Outline the data model for todo items
- [ ] Design the overall bot architecture


- `/todo [item]`: Adds a new todo item to the current channel/conversation's list.
- `/todo done [item_number]`: Marks a specific todo item as done. (Needs to be confirmed if this is the exact command or if it's an interactive message)
- `/todo clear`: Clears all todo items from the current channel/conversation's list.
- `/todo list`: Displays the current todo list for the channel/conversation.


- [ ] Choose a suitable technology stack (language, framework, database)
  - Language: Python
  - Framework: Flask (for handling Slack events and API interactions)
  - Database: SQLite (for simplicity and ease of deployment, can be upgraded later if needed)
- [ ] Outline the data model for todo items
  - Table: `todos`
  - Columns: `id` (primary key), `item_text` (text), `channel_id` (text), `user_id` (text), `is_done` (boolean), `created_at` (timestamp)
- [ ] Design the overall bot architecture
  - Slack App setup (OAuth, permissions, event subscriptions, slash commands)
  - Flask application to receive Slack events (slash commands, interactive messages)
  - Database interactions for storing and retrieving todo items
  - Logic for processing commands and generating responses
